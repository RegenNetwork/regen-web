Wild Geese <br />
By Mary Oliver <br />
<br />
You do not have to be good. <br />
You do not have to walk on your knees <br />
for a hundred miles through the desert repenting. <br />
You only have to let the soft animal of your body <br />
love what it loves. <br />
Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine. <br />
Meanwhile the world goes on. <br />
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain <br />
are moving across the landscapes, <br />
over the prairies and the deep trees, <br />
the mountains and the rivers.<br />
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,<br />
are heading home again.<br />
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,<br />
the world offers itself to your imagination,<br />
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting <br />
over and over announcing your place<br />
in the family of things.<br />
