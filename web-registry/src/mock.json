Set on 1,854ha and at approximately 1,200m above sea level, average annual rainfall of 1,200mm, highly fertile volcanic basalt soils, and complimented by a series of pristine spring fed, year-round natural waterways including five waterfalls, it is quite simply a unique environment for growing cattle.\n\nPrior to the commencement of Wilmot Cattle Company operations in 2008 the property had been conventionally managed. In 2013, a transformation of the property began, moving to more regenerative and holistic management practices, resulting in significant gains in the overall ecological health of the farm.\n\nToday the property is managed in an intensive rotationally grazed system with small numbers of large mobs moving across the landscape, mimicking nature, to create ecological change and improve landscape health and biological function. At shovel depth, our soil organic carbon (SOC) has improved from ~2.5% to >4.5%, with a goal of getting it to >6% by 2023.",

Simply, time controlled rotational grazing optimises the number of stock in a paddock and matches grazing period with available pasture. The aim is to mirror natural herding behaviours by having short graze periods at high density followed by long rest periods allowing the pasture to recover. When managed well, this grazing system increases groundcover, biomass, plant diversity, animal and plant nutrition, soil health, water infiltration and soil organic carbon. A more complete explanation of the science, monitoring tools and management practices is provided below.",
