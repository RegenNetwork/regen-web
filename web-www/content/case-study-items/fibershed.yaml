aboutSection:
  about: md//<a href="https://fibershed.org/" target="_blank">Fibershed</a> is a nonprofit organization that develops fiber and textile systems through a focus on carbon farming, regional production and fiber processing, and public education. Their producer membership includes over 100 agricultural fiber producers in 51 counties in Northern and Central California.
    
    
    Fibershed cultivates textile cultures designed to build soil carbon stocks on the working landscapes on which they depend, while directly enhancing the strength of regional economies. Through strategic grazing, conservation tillage, and a host of scientifically vetted soil carbon enhancing practices, their supply chains create ‘climate beneficial’ textiles and clothing that will become the new standard in a world looking to rapidly mitigate the effects of climate change.

  practice: Rotational Grazing and Prescribed Grazing
  biome: Transition Zone - Temperate / Mediterranean / Subtropical Climate, Predominantly Oak Woodland
  region: Northern California

  description: md//Integrated sheep and vineyard systems, with perennial cropping system.
  challenges:
    - text: Regenerative grazing and monitoring is expensive to implement.
    - text: Farmers need external funding to launch regenerative land management.
approachSection:
  description: With amplified data collection and storage through Regen Network’s tools, Fibershed can obtain funding that furthers and compensates their regenerative practices.
  details: md//Using remote sensing tools and direct measurement algorithms provided by Regen Network, Fibershed can verify the positive ecological impact of prescribed grazing practices at the farm level.
  results: 'md//**Qualitative:** Detection of grazing in vineyards using NDVI
  
    **Quantitative:** 87% accuracy'
  next: md//What’s Next Improving verification methodology using machine learning and more field data. To that end, we recently applied for NRCS Conservation Innovation Grant (CID) in the hope of scaling this throughout California.
