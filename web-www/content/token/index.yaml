    md//Regen Network is a sovereign, proof-of-stake blockchain built on the
    Cosmos SDK. REGEN token is a utility, governance, security and staking
    token.


    REGEN token is designed to ensure utility for ecological data and outcome markets. Regen Network is governed as a public blockchain by token holders following the model outlined and implemented by Cosmos.


    REGEN token will accrue value from levying fees on ecological assets originated and secured on-chain, and from transaction fees paid by users paying for services on the network.

  body: >-
    md//Staking/delegating is a critical function to secure Regen Ledger,
    participate in community governance and support the growth and development
    of Regen Network. Staking also generates rewards for delegators. Delegating
    to validators by staking your REGEN tokens helps cover validator
    infrastructure costs, and will generate between 7% and 20% annual percentage
    rate (APR) on your staked tokens.
