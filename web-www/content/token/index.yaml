  title: Gravity DEX & Osmosis - Liquidity Bootstrapping and Reverse Dutch Auction
  subtitle: "Release date: June 2021"
  body: Early regen community members are collaborating with the Osmosis team to
    make a liquidity bootstrapping pool on the Osmosis dex in the next 60 days.
    This will be the first Cosmos ecosystem initial dex offering (IDO). The
    liquidity bootstrapping pool (LBP) will use a reverse dutch auction
    mechanism that will support fair and sustainable price discovery for our
    community. After price discovery on the Osmosis LBP, we are working to
    ensure there is an Atom-Regen trading as soon as the Gravity DEX is live on
    Cosmos Hub.
