  body: The Regen Ledger (currently in testnet) is a public Proof-of-Stake blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK. It’s primary goal is twofold — indexing claims and assertions pertaining to ecological health, and securely tracking a new class of financial assets, called Ecosystem Service Credits, which are tied to measurable changes in ecological health.

  header: A Key Player in the Cosmos Ecosystem
  body: md//
    The Cosmos SDK is the most widely used proof-of-stake based blockchain development framework in the world. It is the go-to development tool kit for creating a sovereign, energy efficient, highly secure blockchain based application.  Regen Network has always had an ethos of contribution and co-creation.  We now contract directly with the Interchain Foundation as the lead maintainer of the Cosmos SDK, working side by side with the rest of the cosmos ecosystem.

    
    With the advent of IBC, any Cosmos SDK blockchain connected to the Cosmos Hub will be able to interact with the assets and ecological data on Regen Ledger. If you want to learn more about building on top of the Cosmos SDK, check out the <a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/" target="_blank">docs</a>, or say hello to us on the <a href="https://discord.gg/HbvhWZw" target="_blank">Cosmos Community Discord</a>!
