  body: The Regen Ledger (currently in testnet) is a public Proof-of-Stake
    blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK. It’s primary goal is twofold — indexing
    claims and assertions pertaining to ecological health, and securely tracking
    a new class of financial assets, called Ecosystem Service Credits, which are
    tied to measurable changes in ecological health.

    md//Regen Network welcomes active engagement from software developers
    working in blockchain, climate solutions or agricultural technology to get
    involved in our community driven, open-source approach to protocol design.

  header: A Key Player in the Cosmos Ecosystem
  body: >-
    md//The Cosmos SDK is the most widely used proof-of-stake based blockchain
    development framework in the world. It is the go-to development tool kit for
    creating a sovereign, energy efficient, highly secure blockchain based
    application.  Regen Network has always had an ethos of contribution and
    co-creation.  We now contract directly with the Interchain Foundation as the
    lead maintainer of the Cosmos SDK, working side by side with the rest of the
    cosmos ecosystem.


    With the advent of IBC, any Cosmos SDK blockchain connected to the Cosmos Hub will be able to interact with the assets and ecological data on Regen Ledger. If you want to learn more about building on top of the Cosmos SDK, check out the <a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/" target="_blank">docs</a>, or say hello to us on the <a href="https://discord.gg/HbvhWZw" target="_blank">Cosmos Community Discord</a>!

  body: >-
    md//Since 2019, Regen Network has been an active member of the OpenTEAM
    community, a multi-year federally funded initiative for the development of
    an open source, interoperable, and farmer first approach to agriculture
    technology.


    The many technology projects in OpenTEAM (ranging from <a href="https://farmos.org/" target="_blank">FarmOS</a>, to <a href="http://comet-farm.com/" target="_blank">CometFARM</a>, to <a href="https://coolfarmtool.org/" target="_blank">Cool Farm Tool</a>) meet on a weekly basis to track progress on new integrations, interoperability standards, and other collaborations.
