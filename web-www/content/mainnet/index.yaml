        trading, and retiring of credits pertaining to verifiable changes in
        ecosystem health. Itâ€™s designed to function as an open platform for
        credit designers, and will first be used for Regen Network's own
        CarbonPlus Grasslands credit.

    - title: Data
      description: The Data Module is intended to sit alongside the Ecocredit Module,
        serving as a flexible yet opinionated module for storing complex
        metadata and registering data schemas pertaining to a ecocredit batch or
        ecosystem service project.
