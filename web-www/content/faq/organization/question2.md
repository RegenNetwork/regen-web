description: Is Regen Network decentralized?
---
Regen Networkâ€™s decentralized backbone, Regen Ledger, is decentralized by design. The proof of stake tokens will be widely distributed and different organizations are already responsible for ensuring the success of the larger network vision. We are actively seeking members for our Community Staking DAO program, so if you are a developer, scientist, or land steward, please reach out to engage and support this network being as decentralized as possible at launch.
