description: Is Regen Network decentralized?
---
Regen Network is governed by a democratic body which delegates votes through compute/validator nodes. Voting is transparent, and the incentive structures are designed to uphold truth about ecological information and create a contracting system to value ecological health. All stakeholders in the system benefit from this common good outcome and the cost to cheat or lie is much higher than the benefits.
