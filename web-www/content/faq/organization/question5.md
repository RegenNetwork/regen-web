**Develop:** Use our open tech stack to build your own ecological application. Develop a new scientific methodology for verifying ecological state or quantifying ecosystem services.

**Validate**: Run a validator on our testnets to grow your reputation and your XRN token holdings to make it into the active validator set at main net launch.

**Invest:** There are two sales happening concurrently right now for the XRN token. The first is a Reg D token sale which can only involve US-based accredited investors as the SEC defines it. The second sale is a Reg S sale that excludes “US persons” from participating, and there is not particular accredited investors statute in those regulations, but the laws of the domicile of the investor must be adhered to. You can reach out to christian@regen.network for more information.

**Partner:** Work with us to build the network through strategic partnerships.
