description: How would you describe the constellation of entities referred to as
  Regen Network?
---
**Regen Network** is the overarching whole. Although we often refer to ourselves as Regen Network, the Network is not an organization, but rather a community, a commons, a movement, a public blockchain-based protocol, and a network.

**Regen Network Development, Inc.** is a Delaware C-Corp running the token sale to capitalize the development of Regen Network. Much of the team you see listed on the website are housed out of RND.

**Regen Foundation** is a Delaware 501(c)(3) Organization. Regen Foundation focuses on the pillars of Open Science, Education and Capacity Building, and Technological Tools for the commons. Regen Foundation will govern 5% of the token supply of Regen Ledger as an independent entity after main net launches.
