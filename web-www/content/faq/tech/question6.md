description: Which protocols are you developing and why?
---
There are several criteria to be taken into account in protocol development. Technical feasibility, how it would compare to existing industry methods, how well the underlying data can encourage positive change in our ecology, whether there is an existing market demand, if so, at what cost points, how much human ground truthing is required, and finally would such a protocol be positioned to actually influence current systems of production. With all of these factors in mind, here are some of the protocols currently in the works.

Till / No Till - highly feasible via satellite, little to no ground truth, strong market demand, has a great positive effect on building and maintaining soil health.

Cover Cropping - highly feasible via satellite, similar to till/no till in most respects.

Crop Identification - also highly feasible, some market and policy value

Pollinator Strips - very feasible, strong environmental/production/social benefits

Fire Risk Assessment - satellite/drone, can track leaf moisture and fire breaks

Riparian Zones - medium high feasibility, extraordinary environmental benefits

Erosion - medium satellite feasibility, needs more groundtruth, strong production

Ocean Plastic - medium satellite feasibility, could easily identify cleaning crews

Endangered Species - medium satellite / groundtruth balance, identify habitat

Air Quality - satellite and IOT in urban areas, strong policy incentives

Urban Trees - high feasibility with satellite, good policy incentives

Above Ground Biomass - satellite feasible, could be used in a variety of programs

Biodiversity Index - primarily satellite, more feasible with fixed wing drones, policy

Water Quality - also a policy piece, Satellite + IOT, and groundtruth

Carbon Sequestration - requires a lot of initial groundtruth, however with sufficient amassing of data, possible shift to Modeling based on Satellite Imagery correlatives. Very strong market and policy demand.

**Polycropping/Agroforestry - might require more groundtruth/drones initially, and could perhaps be moved up into satellite. Huge ecological and social benefits.**
