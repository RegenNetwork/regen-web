Regen Networkâ€™s governance model is Proof of Stake with a substantial upgrade: the Community Staking DAO allocation. The hybrid of pure PoS with an identity and reputation based community of organizations securing and governing the network will create a best in class trust layer for verifying, securing and exchanging natural capital assets.
