description: "  What are Regen Network's Values?"
---
Regen Networkâ€™s values can best be expressed in pairing words that normally seemed opposed. We find strength in holding complexity with care and imbuing technology with intention in service to regeneration.

Agency and Cooperation

Equity and Responsibility

Care and Initiative

As a team, we engage in rigorous self-reflection and believe in capacity building and personal and societal evolution. We aim to build a network in which the value created and exchanged always results in a net gain of health, and vitality for the network participants and the planet. In short, we are moving beyond a zero-sum game.
