description: When are Carbonplus Credits issued?
---
The first Carbonplus Credits issuance happens after a new project has completed the baseline and two monitoring rounds, in Year 2 of the project. The Monitoring Methodology requires a minimum of six monitoring rounds in the 10 year Crediting Term. After each monitoring event, if there is positive change in soil carbon stocks since the last monitoring, projects can elect to issue Carbonplus Credits.
