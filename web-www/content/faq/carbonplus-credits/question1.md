description: What is a CarbonPlus credit?
---
CarbonPlus credits are voluntary carbon credits. Each credit represents one tonne of CO2e removed from the atmosphere and stored in the soil or biomass. On top of carbon removal, credits also include ecological and social co-benefits, such as soil health, ecosystem health, and animal welfare.

Both the carbon sequestration and the co-benefits are measured. The number of credits are issued solely based on the tons of CO2e sequestered, measured based on remote sensing analysis in combination with a limited set of soil samples.

In the case of the CarbonPlus Grasslands Credit, Livestock emissions (N2O and CH4) quantification is based on the number of livestock and number of days they spent in the project area.
