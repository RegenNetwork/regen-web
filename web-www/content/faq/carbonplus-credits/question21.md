At this time, Regen Network is the only approved monitor. 

Regen Network invites 3rd party monitors to apply for approval to become Monitors on Regen Registry. Monitors must provide monitoring services based on the published, peer-review methodologies approved by Regen Registry. 

See the Program Guide for more details.
