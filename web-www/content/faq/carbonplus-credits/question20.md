description: Is Monitoring performed during the Permanence Period?
---
Projects that choose to utilize a Permanence Reversal Buffer (rather than putting the land under covenant) are required to complete a monitoring round at the end of the Permanence Period to reconcile carbon stock levels and address any carbon stock reversals that may have occurred. See the Program Guideâ€™s Permanence Reversal Buffer section for more details.
