Carbonplus Credits returns are highly dependent on two factors:

* Credit Price - which fluctuates with the demand and supply of the voluntary carbon credit markets
* Carbon Sequestration Rate - which depends on land management and climatic conditions

Example:

We project average returns (net margins) of above 15% year on year, or $5 per hectare per yer. This assumes a price of $10 per each Carbonplus Credit and a Carbon Sequestration Rate of 0.41 tC per hectare per year.

*RND, Inc. cannot guarantee the above returns. It is the responsibility of each project proponent to perform their own due diligence.*
