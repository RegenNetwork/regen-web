description: How are carbon removals quantified?
---
Carbon removals are calculated using standard GHG accounting practices. Soil Organic Carbon percentages measured in soil samples are calibrated with [Sentinel 2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) satellite imagery in a given monitoring time period to calculate the changes in Soil Organic Carbon stocks from the baseline measurement.
