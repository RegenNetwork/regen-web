description: How are the Carbonplus Credits ecological co-benefits measured?
---
In the case of the Carbonplus Grasslands Credits:

* Ecosystem health is based on the Costanza Framework, measuring its ability to maintain structure (organization) and function (vigor) over time in the face of external stress (resilience).
* Soil health is based on Cornell Universityâ€™s Soil Health Assessment, assessing micronutrients and macronutrients.
* Animal welfare is based on adherence to national animal welfare standards that track nutrition level, access to water, social contact, and more key factors.

  *Guidance for additional ecological co-benefits measurement is forthcoming.*
