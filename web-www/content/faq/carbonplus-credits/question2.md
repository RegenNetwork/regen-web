description: What are the Carbonplus Credit terms related to greenhouse gas accounting?
---
1. **Additionality** - based on adopting a new activity from a pre-approved list which includes activities approved by either the Australian Governmentâ€™s Carbon Farming Initiative or the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Healthy Soils Program (HSP). We accept adoption dates (the date the new project activity was applied) up to 10 years prior to project registration.
2. **Permanence** - 25 year, either through covenant or dedicated reversal buffer (5% of each issuance)
3. **Buffer Pool** - 20% of each issuance is allocated to a dedicated uncertainty pool (note, this is a separate account than the Permanence Reversal Buffer)
4. **Leakage** - market leakage related to grassland management activities is likely to be negligible (de minimis) but if project proponents expect above de minimis rates, an appropriate discount factor will be applied during the GHG quantification.
5. **Double Counting** - project proponents will be required to commit to not applying for credits for the same land and emission reduction/removal concurrently on any other registry / GHG Program
6. **Verification** - an independent third-party verifier provides an assurance of the integrity of the data and information provided by project proponents and the monitoring process
