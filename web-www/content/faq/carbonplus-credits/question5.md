description: What are the costs to manage a Carbonplus Credits project?
---
The costs for a Carbonplus Credit project are:

* Monitoring:

  * Soil Sampling  - soil sampling collection and lab analysis ($25 - $100 per sample)
  * Remote Sensing Analysis - quantifies GHG based on Soil Organic Carbon measurements and satellite imagery ($7,500 to $15,000 per monitoring round)
* Verification: independent 3rd party auditor ($5,000 to $15,000 per monitoring round)
* Carbonplus Credit Issuance fees: Regen Network charges a fee for each credit issuance.
* Carbonplus Credit Brokerage fees: Regen Network charges a fee for optional brokerage services.

*The Carbonplus Credit Issuance and Carbonplus Credit Brokerage fees are deferred to issuance and sale respectively, and therefore are not upfront costs. Regen Network does not fulfill the role of Verifier for projects where Regen Network is the monitor. This requires an external party, and fees associated are not charged by Regen Network Development, Inc.*
