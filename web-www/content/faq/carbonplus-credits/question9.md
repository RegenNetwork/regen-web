description: Can historical project data be used to monitor and issue Carbonplus Credits?
---
If the adoption date of the approved project activity is within 10 years prior to project registration, we can accept historical soil sampling data as early as 2017. 

Carbonplus Grasslands Credits projects must follow the instructions provided in Regen Networkâ€™s [Methodology for Soil Sampling in Grazing Systems](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rn-BhjCxKHfnmenSqNcx0wW9j1_pNjXP/view?usp=sharing) to align with the monitoring protocol. If the monitor can verify that Soil Organic Carbon has been sequestered over these historical time periods, your project may be eligible for credit issuance for 2017 onward.
