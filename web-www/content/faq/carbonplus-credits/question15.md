description: What happens if a project loses Soil Organic Carbon in a given year?
---
Regen Network recognize that Soil Organic Carbon stocks fluctuate naturally, especially during extreme climatic conditions, such as drought. At the end of the project term we reconcile the Soil Organic Carbon stock level with the prior monitored level. If Soil Organic Carbon has been lost we use the Buffer Pool to accommodate the carbon stock gap. See the Program Guideâ€™s Buffer Pool section for more details.
