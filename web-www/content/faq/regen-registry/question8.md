description: How is Regen Registry different from other programs that help land
  stewards receive payments for carbon removals and ecological services?
---
Regen Registry was designed from the ground-up with a team of farmers, ranchers, and land stewards to address many of the challenges with existing ecological payments programs:

**Regen Registry Offers Low Project Costs**

* Low Cost - significantly lower than existing registries, which require consultants to perform manual in-situ measurements; Regen Registry relies on automated remote sensing monitoring to streamline projects costs.
* Minimal Registry Fees - Regen Registry charges a single fee for credit issuance. There are no account fees, project listing fees, transfer fees, activation fee, etc.
* Share Upfront Project Costs - Regen Registry supports multi-party ownership of Carbonplus Credits to enable the sharing of upfront costs between farmers, land owners and/or project developers. Further, through aggregated projects with multiple local farmers, monitoring and verification costs can be further streamlined.

**Regen Registry Creates Additional Revenue Streams**

* Premiums - Project Pages on Regen Registry tell the unique story of each land steward and ecological practice. Carbonplus Credit buyers can explore projects with holistic ecological impacts, including carbon stock measurement, ecological co-benefits, and UN Sustainable Development Goal outcomes. Each project's ecological impact on Regen Registry is unique, which translates into premium Carbonplus Credits.
* Simplified Payments - integrated payment platform provides direct real-time payments, including credit card, bank, and mobile. 
* Affordable Brokerage Services - Regen Registry offers affordable, optional brokerage services.
