description: How are CarbonPlus Credits issued for a project on Regen Registry?
---
Each Carbonplus Credit represents 1 ton of CO2e removed from the atmosphere. 

The approved Methodology for each Credit Class defines how each underlying indicator, such as Soil Organic Carbon, is measured. Regen Registry issues Carbonplus Credits based on the difference between the latest monitoring roundâ€™s measurements and the measurements during the latest issuance event (or the baseline measurement if this is the first issuance). When there is an increase in carbon stocks between monitoring rounds, a Project Proponent can issue a Carbonplus Credit. 

Example: 

If a Baseline measurement = 1000 tons of CO2e and a Monitoring round measurement = 6000 tons of CO2e after uncertainty deductions, Regen Registry will issue 5000 Carbonplus Credits (representing 5000 tons of CO2e) to the Project Proponent. Since the 5,000 Carbonplus Credits are subject to Buffer Pool and Permanece Reversal Buffer deductions, the Project Proponent will receive 4000 credits (after 20% deductions).
