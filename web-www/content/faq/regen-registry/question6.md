  issue Carbonplus Credits for?

The CarbonPlus Grasslands Credit focuses on Soil Organic Carbon in grasslands and pastureland. 

Other CarbonPlus Credits in development include forestry-based Credits (afforestation, reforestation, avoided deforestation, and agroforestry) and cropland-based Soil Organic Carbon Credits (no-till and low-till, cover crop, and crop rotation).

In the future, Regen Registry will invite Credit designers and Methodology developers to innovate and design new Credits and Methodologies, subject to the approval and peer review processes required by Regen Registry.
