description: How is project data managed?
---
Regen Network aims to provide maximum transparency to Carbonplus Credit buyers and other stakeholders by making the project documentation, including the Project Plan, Baseline Report, Monitoring Reports, and Verification Reports, publicly available on each Project Page. The data provided as inputs for the Monitoring and Verification process is not made public, but rather the outputs.

*In order to provide Project Proponents with data privacy, the [Project Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wM6LND5SASmwlJ71PqEZZ_L8ECSxEDc0nl98978HRrI/edit?usp=sharing) permits the designation of certain information as “commercially sensitive.” This information will be excluded from the public version of the Project Plan that is made available on the Project Page on Regen Registry.*
