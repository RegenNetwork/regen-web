Financing carbon offsets / removals is a core component of climate action for companies and individuals. Climate commitments can help:

1. **Deliver on Climate Action Goals:** Contribute to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement by making a direct investment in the low-carbon transition through supporting carbon removal projects.
2. **Make an Impact towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals:** Regen Registry projects measure regenerative environmental and social co-benefits that deliver UN Sustainable Development Goal impacts.
3. **Gain Recognition by Civil Society:** Companies are motivated to remove their carbon footprint and engage in credible climate impact strategies.
4. **Make Climate Claims:** Purchases of carbon offsets / removals that are equivalent to or greater than your carbon footprint can be used to fulfill ‘carbon neutral,’ ‘climate neutral,’ and ‘climate positive’ claims.
5. **Invest Directly in Farmers and Land Stewards:** Carbonplus Credit purchases contribute 75 cents of each dollar directly to Project Proponents to continue and expand their ecologically postive land stewardship.
