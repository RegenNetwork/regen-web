description: What does XRN allow me to do?
---
XRN are the native governance token of Regen Network. Assuming the token holder stakes their tokens, they allow one to participate in the governance of the chain, receive block rewards and receive their share of the inflation mechanism. As the native token for Regen Ledger, XRN must be used to pay for transaction costs on-chain.
