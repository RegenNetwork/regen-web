---
At the Token Generation Event, which is scheduled for Q1, 2021, 100,000,000 REGEN will be created and distributed to the various wallets and contracts as dictated by the genesis file. From that point forward, the only Regen Tokens that will be added to the supply are through a mechanism referred to as inflation, which is a Proof of Stake mechanism to encourage token holders to stake their tokens and participate in governance.
