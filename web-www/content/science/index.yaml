    md// Regen Network is empowering an open community of scientists to build
    and deploy cutting edge methodologies to measure ecological health and make
    scientifically robust claims.


    Earth observation science, landscape ecology, and our ability to understand complex ecological systems is undergoing a technological revolution. Regen Network in the vanguard of this movement to make climate science available to the people and markets who need it most.


    Join us in service of better decision-making, better markets, and collective action on climate.

      description: Develop cutting edge earth observation and remote sensing
        methodologies to verify ecological state.
    - title: Phase II
      description: Methodology registry where different methodologies, both mature and
        nascent, are registered on the Regen Ledger for scientific comparison,
        peer review and rating.
    - title: Phase III
      description: Develop robust, peer-to-peer methodology and scientific data market
        place and tailored user experience for scientists.

        Technology Ecosystem for Agricultural Management</a> brings together
        almost two dozen entities—including government agencies, research
        institutions, nonprofits, and corporations—to build open source tools
        that improve the ability of farmers and ranchers to make informed
        management decisions about their land in ways that result in increased
        landscape health. As a partner in this endeavor, we at Regen are
        contributing our expertise and technology regarding remote sensing of
        ecological indicators, durable and interoperable storage of ecological
        data, and governance of decentralized networks.
