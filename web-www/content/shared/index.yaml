    md// This credit measures carbon sequestration and a suite of co-benefits,
    including ecosystem health, animal welfare, and soil health.


    Our first vintages of this credit were issued to [Wilmot](/registry/projects/wilmot) and [Woodburn](https://www.regen.network/registry/projects/woodburn) which have increased soil organic carbon concentration through rotational grazing to 4.5% and 3.4% respectively. These vintages represent one of the largest issuances to agricultural projects to-date in Australia! The credits have already been sold to a major tech corporation to help meet their climate goals.
