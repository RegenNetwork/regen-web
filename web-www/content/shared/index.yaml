    md// This credit measures carbon sequestration and a suite of co-benefits,
    including ecosystem health, animal welfare, and soil health.


    Our first vintage of this credit is issued to the [Wilmot property](/registry/projects/impactag) which has increased soil organic carbon through rotational grazing to 4.5%. This vintage is one of the largest issuances to agricultural projects to-date in Australia!
